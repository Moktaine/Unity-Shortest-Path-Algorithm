Made in early stages of my coding and gamedev journey. Excuse the nested loops and poor coding please. Thank you!

The shortest path algorithm is in Character.cs file. 

The Algorithm knows the character's and collectible's location. Based on those information it tries to find the shortest path to collect 
all the collectibles without crashing in to any obstacle.
